Pablo Alcorta <Pablo.Alcorta@perthairport.com.au>\nSubject:Re: Zycus\nGood afternoon Louisa, Pablo,\nFurther to your request last week for a ball-park enterprise pricing to cover the license needs for Perth Airport, I'd like to first provide some context to the Zycus pricing model.Firstly, Zycus is a Saas software provider, hence our Customers don't actually \"buy\" our software, rather, they pay a yearly subscription cost that allows them to use the software for a year until the agreement is renewed.Our typical agreement is for 5-years.The license subscription cost is largely based on the number and type of users and the modules in scope.In best interest of our Customers, we leverage economies of scale which means we provide better discounts with higher number of modules and users, typicallyin a bundle as opposed to ala carte or by line item.This takes into considerationpresent and future user requirements, budget, timing etc.and represents the most optimum way to purchase Zycus licenses.A mentioned during out meeting, our objective isto provide licenses that would cover our Customer's needs over the entire Agreement period.There are no mechanisms in place that would escalate the subscription costs over the life of the licenses agreement.\nThat said, we have projected the number of users in the ballpark of 10 Power Users, 20 Business Users in the draft license pricing.A one-time implementation fee has also been estimated to expose the true costs, completely free of any hidden or surprisecharges.This number is contingent on the complexityof the implementation which includes the integration with your ERP system.We strongly encourage a scoping session to be performed so as to enable us to develop a project scope.Based on ROI modelling,we typically see ROI's of at least 8-15 times the investment, typically within a 3 year period.This price includes the key modules including iSourcing, iContract, iSupplier, Merlin Intake and all the accompanying Gen AI infused into each of these modules.We have incorporated some growth into that number for the duration of the Agreement.\nThe price estimate for the above as follows:\n<image.png>\nPlease note that the pricing above does not constitute an offer or a proposal and is subject to the Management's approval.At Zycus, we meet you where you're at.We are very flexible in our payment terms, and in many instances, where it makes sense, help our Customers time invoices and payments in a manner that leverages available current FY funds and next FY's funds.While wehave our own license agreement, we are also open to using Perth Airport's purchase agreements.Please let me know if you have any questions.I'm suggesting the following next steps:A quick Team's call to go through the commercial aspects of the attached and answer any questions you may have.A deeper dive into the solution set and functionality, as well as how we envision our solution to bring value add to Perth Airport's business needs.Do let me know if there are any questions.Thanks and warm regards,\nStanley Chia\nDirector of Sales - ANZ\n+61 493 660 777\nstanley.chia@zycus.com\n<Outlook-fzrjnoxv.png>\nFrom:Louisa Cotter <Louisa.Cotter@perthairport.com.au>\nSent:Friday, June 6, 2025 10:50 AM\nTo:Stanley Chia <stanley.chia@zycus.com>;

Pablo Alcorta <Pablo.Alcorta@perthairport.com.au>Subject:Re: Zycus\nGood afternoon Louisa, Pablo,Further to your request last week for a ball-park enterprise pricing to cover the license needs for Perth Airport, I'd like to first provide some context to the Zycus pricing model.Firstly, Zycus is a Saas software provider, hence our Customers don't actually \"buy\" our software, rather, they pay a yearly subscription cost that allows them to use the software for a year until the agreement is renewed.Our typical agreement is for 5-years.The license subscription cost is largely based on the number and type of users and the modules in scope.In best interest of our Customers, we leverage economies of scale which means we provide better discounts with higher number of modules and users, typicallyin a bundle as opposed to ala carte or by line item.This takes into considerationpresent and future user requirements, budget, timing etc.and represents the most optimum way to purchase Zycus licenses.A mentioned during out meeting, our objective isto provide licenses that would cover our Customer's needs over the entire Agreement period.There are no mechanisms in place that would escalate the subscription costs over the life of the licenses agreement.That said, we have projected the number of users in the ballpark of 10 Power Users, 20 Business Users in the draft license pricing.A one-time implementation fee has also been estimated to expose the true costs, completely free of any hidden or surprisecharges.This number is contingent on the complexityof the implementation which includes the integration with your ERP system.We strongly encourage a scoping session to be performed so as to enable us to develop a project scope.Based on ROI modelling,we typically see ROI's of at least 8-15 times the investment, typically within a 3 year period.This price includes the key modules including iSourcing, iContract, iSupplier, Merlin Intake and all the accompanying Gen AI infused into each of these modules.We have incorporated some growth into that number for the duration of the Agreement.The price estimate for the above as follows:<image.png>Please note that the pricing above does not constitute an offer or a proposal and is subject to the Management's approval.At Zycus, we meet you where you're at.We are very flexible in our payment terms, and in many instances, where it makes sense, help our Customers time invoices and payments in a manner that leverages available current FY funds and next FY's funds.While wehave our own license agreement, we are also open to using Perth Airport's purchase agreements.Please let me know if you have any questions.I'm suggesting the following next steps:A quick Team's call to go through the commercial aspects of the attached and answer any questions you may have.A deeper dive into the solution set and functionality, as well as how we envision our solution to bring value add to Perth Airport's business needs.Do let me know if there are any questions.Thanks and warm regards,Stanley ChiaDirector of Sales - ANZ+61 493 660 777stanley.chia@zycus.com<Outlook-fzrjnoxv.png>\n\nFrom:Louisa Cotter <Louisa.Cotter@perthairport.com.au>Sent:Friday, June 6, 2025 10:50 AMTo:Stanley Chia <stanley.chia@zycus.com>;
