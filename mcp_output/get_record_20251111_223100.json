  "Description": "RTX is reassessing its spend analytics capabilities due to inefficiencies with the current Accenture-built tool, which requires heavy manual reclassification and delays clean spend data until April/May. They are seeking an AI-driven, automated spend analytics solution with near 100% accuracy, harmonized taxonomy (UNSPSC-based), and strong cybersecurity compliance (ISO 27001, SOC 1/2, FedRAMP). Decision-making is led by the VP for non-product procurement, with high importance placed on aerospace and defense references (Lockheed, Boeing, Tata). The opportunity is to position Zycus as a proven partner offering AI-led classification, process efficiency, and secure data hosting tailored to defense sector standards.",
