    "Subject": "RTX X Zycus : Introductory Call",
    "Description": "-- Avoma Note Start --\r\n Avoma - : RTX X Zycus : Introductory Call <> September 08, 2025 at 2:00 PM UTC\r\n Avoma Meeting: https://app.avoma.com/meetings/4b86cfc9-c7f5-416f-83a9-917845a226d0/notes\r\n## Participants\r\n\r\n  * Zycus: Gongiti Naraian, Marc Quessenberry, Ronit Wadhwa, Iranna Kongali\r\n\r\n  * Rtx: Robichon, Cecil (FRA)\r\n\r\n## Key Takeaways\r\n\r\n  * Frustration was highlighted with the current spend analytics solution, which relies on manual reclassification and unsatisfactory AI logic.\r\n  * Emphasis was placed on the need for a robust, AI-driven spend analytics tool that supports a harmonized taxonomy based on UNSPSC, reflecting their recent internal realignment.\r\n  * Cybersecurity and data integrity concerns were raised, requiring compliance with IT security standards such as Fedramp, ISO 27001, and periodic audit reports.\r\n  * Securing strong references from the aerospace and defense sectors, including established names like Lockheed Martin, was identified as a critical evaluation criterion.\r\n  * Next steps involve sending detailed spend analytics materials, followed by arranging a demo after internal review by the VP and process tools team.\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\n  * Ronit Wadhwa\r\n\r\n    * Share an IT security datasheet along with spend analysis offering documents that detail AI capabilities and cybersecurity credentials post-call.\r\n  * Marc Quessenberry\r\n\r\n    * Follow up with Cecil Robichon regarding the spend analytics materials and confirm if the initiative is being led by the VP.\r\n    * Compile and send spend analysis materials focused on spend analytics capabilities to RTX and follow up next week.\r\n  * Robichon, Cecil (FRA)\r\n\r\n    * Let they know if Robichon, need anything else. and Robichon, look forward again to receive the materials and let they know if Robichon, need anything else\r\n\r\n## Aerospace and Defense Sector Specifics\r\n\r\n  * Company transformation details were provided, noting RTX\u2019s merger history, current status as the largest aerospace and defense company with $80B in annual revenue, and organic growth of 10% YoY.\r\n  * Emphasis on the critical need for partner solutions to have proven experience and strong references in both aerospace and defense sectors.\r\n  * References to key industry players such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Tata Advanced Systems were mentioned as benchmarks for required credibility in the defense sector.\r\n\r\n## Procurement Process Efficiency and Organizational Transformation\r\n\r\n  * Initiative led by a VP for non-product procurement, driven by reassessment of spend analytics capabilities to align with new operational and strategic priorities post-merger.\r\n  * Focus on ensuring new tools add value by decreasing manual workload and improving data accuracy, which aligns with RTX\u2019s broader goals of enhanced process efficiency.\r\n  * Pain point highlighted by lengthy manual reclassification processes that detract from strategic procurement activities like renegotiation and contracting.\r\n\r\n## Spend Analytics Reassessment\r\n\r\n  * Past implementation at GE is highlighted as a positive reference for applying enhanced AI-driven classification.\r\n  * RTX is reassessing spend analytics due to inefficiencies with the current Accenture-developed tool that requires extensive manual reclassification, delaying clean spend data until April/May.\r\n\r\n## Spend Analytics Challenges and Needs\r\n\r\n  * Desire to reduce manual data reclassification and achieve near 97-100% accuracy through automated classification, addressing the pain point of inefficient spend management.\r\n  * Interest in a solution that streamlines spend analytics focused on precise, automated classification and offers a dedicated, focused approach to spend analytics.\r\n  * Current spend analytics tool, developed by Accenture, requires extensive manual classification causing significant delays, sometimes extending to May each year.\r\n\r\n## Taxonomy Harmonization and Classification Requirements\r\n\r\n  * Expectation that the solution can support custom taxonomies or hybrid models that blend corporate taxonomies with industry standards for global consistency.\r\n  * Emphasis on consistent categorization across business units to eliminate past discrepancies where different divisions used different taxonomies.\r\n  * The existing taxonomy splits non-product spending into distinct categories such as supply chain and Employee Services, harmonized globally using UNSPSC codes.\r\n\r\n## Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Requirements\r\n\r\n  * Demand for detailed IT security documentation including ISO 27001, SOC 1, SOC 2 certifications and annual audit reports to satisfy internal compliance teams.\r\n  * Need assurance of data residing in secure US or European (GDPR compliant) data centers, as dictated by defense sector standards.\r\n  * Requirement for strong cybersecurity measures including FedRAMP certification, especially given the sensitive nature of aerospace and defense data.\r\n\r\n## Cybersecurity Concerns\r\n\r\n  * RTX requires robust cybersecurity; Zycus offers data hosted in US (with EU option), ISO 27001 certification, and SOC 1 and SOC 2 compliance with annual audits.\r\n  * FedRAMP certification is under consideration to meet the needs for managing sensitive aerospace and defense data.\r\n\r\n## Industry References\r\n\r\n  * Zycus has aerospace/defense references including Lockheed Martin and is in active engagement with Boeing for similar services.\r\n  * Additional reference includes Tata Advanced Systems Limited, a defense manufacturer using Zycus\u2019s capabilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n-- Avoma Note End --",
