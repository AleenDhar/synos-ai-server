Hi Zyad, I know Tanya is tied up so I will answer for her .... ....She is currently based from India (though we are hoping to relocate her to Dubai soon), in the meantime, we are trying to arrange a regular Dubai visit starting sometime in the next couple of weeks, so we are hoping we can make a face-to-face session.... however, if there is any urgency I can be there face to face and she can dial in.

The considerations in coming year is to look at CLM as a standalone feature. I can try blocking calendars for the steering committee for Zycus to take us through a high level discovery/estimates and benefits. The merlin in take can also then be discussed however for the right level of interest/engagement from stakeholders, shall initiate this session for the CLM part for now. Let me know on how your/team\u2019s calendar looks like in the coming week and I can then formalize an invite (Teams/in person \u2013 whatever suits) My regards to Dan and Carl.

Hi Zyad, Thank you for joining the Procurement AI World Tour \u2013 Dubai Edition last evening. It was a pleasure hosting you, and we truly valued the candid discussions on today\u2019s procurement challenges. The demo of Merlin Intake also resonated well in showing how it can simplify the buying process and improve overall user happiness. As we discussed, you highlighted a strong interest in how Zycus supports procurement functions\u2014across sourcing, contracting, supplier risk management, spend analytics, and beyond. To keep the momentum going, I\u2019d love to set up a short discovery session tailored to your priorities. Could you kindly share a couple of time slots that work best for you in the coming days? I\u2019ll be happy to coordinate accordingly. Also, thank you once again for sharing your video byte at the event\u2014it means a lot to us. Wishing you all the very best for your panel discussion on the ESG topic today.

executed versions, redlines, and audit history are visible and updated automatically\n  * Automated renewal alerts and milestones trigger notifications at 12, 6, and 3 months before contract expiry\n\n## CLM Features & AI Enhancements\n\n  * IContract authoring supports configurable template library or AI-powered OCR upload that auto-populates form fields for new agreements.\n  * Contract Craft Pro analyzes configured clause rules and historical contracts to recommend missing, amendable, or inapplicable clauses.\n  * Instareview evaluates red-lined contracts to assign a risk exposure score and maintains a detailed audit trail for every revision.\n  * Repository auto-generates renewal milestones and alerts (e.g., 3 years, 6 months, 1 year before expiry) once a contract is executed.\n\n## Follow-up & Demo Coordination\n\n  * Client to gather internal IT integration feedback;
