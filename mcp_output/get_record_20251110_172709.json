It operates campuses in Missouri, Arizona, and California, offering graduate programs in medicine, dentistry, and health sciences. ATSU is currently expanding its footprint by relocating its College for Healthy Communities from Santa Maria to a new 65,000 sq ft facility in San Luis Obispo, opening in 2026, to enhance training and regional healthcare impact. Additionally, in 2025, ATSU formed a strategic partnership with George Fox University in Oregon to strengthen rural healthcare education and create new clinical and student pathways.",
