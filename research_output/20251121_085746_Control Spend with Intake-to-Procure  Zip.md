## Intake-to-procure frequently asked questions

### What is intake-to-procure software?

Intake-to-procure software provides a centralized interface for employees to request, approve, and collaborate on procurement processes. Common use cases for intake-to-procure software include purchase request intake, vendor onboarding, contract execution, and more.

### Who is involved in the intake-to-procure software process?

Procurement processes typically involve multiple teams. A single request may need approval from finance, security, IT, and legal. With Zip’s user-friendly intake-to-procure software, you can easily set up customizable workflows so each request is routed to the right approver at the right time.

### What are the steps involved in the intake-to-procure software process?

Procurement workflows can vary a bit between organizations, but it typically begins with a request to purchase something – a tool, a SaaS product, or even a consultation service. Next, the finance team will review and approve the request from a budgetary standpoint. Various teams like IT, security, and legal may also need to review the request to ensure it complies with internal policies. The final steps of the intake-to-procure process typically involve signing a contract with the vendor and finalizing the details of the purchase in order to generate an accurate purchase order. POs, invoicing, and payments are typical steps in a [procure-to-pay](/products/procure-to-pay) process.

### How long does the intake-to-procure software process typically take?

Organizations of all sizes often struggle with disorganized and slow intake-to-procure processes, but the problem can become especially pronounced in large organizations where systems have grown in complexity. Relying on manual processes and coordinating details over Slack or email can significantly delay purchases. Customers who implement Zip’s Intake-to-Procure software have seen their cycle times fall dramatically, from days or even weeks to mere hours.

### How are vendor selections made during the intake-to-procure software process?

One of the many advantages of supporting procurement processes with intake-to-procure software is that it provides early visibility for the procurement team on what an organization needs to buy. That early visibility is key – procurement teams need adequate time to [research, identify, and select vendors](/blog/top-rfp-questions-to-ask-vendors) as well as to negotiate the best pricing.

### What are the benefits of using intake-to-procure software?

Intake-to-procure software replaces outdated, manual procurement processes that frustrate employees and hamper productivity. Adopting a platform like Zip means that people get what they need faster, while organizations can spend their money more strategically and reduce IT, security, and legal risks.
